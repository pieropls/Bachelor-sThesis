# Working Hour and Income: Effects on Sleep

This repository contains the comprehensive suite of documents and code that comprise a bi-disciplinary bachelor's thesis project blending mathematics and econometrics to explore how work hours and income influence sleep patterns, and the subsequent implications on health and productivity. This analysis employs linear regressions and R programming to analyze a dataset sourced from the US Time Use Study.

## Project Overview

The core question addressed in this project is: "How do work hours and income influence sleep, and what are the implications for health and productivity?" The motivation for this research stems from observing increased work hours and its potential impact on sleep and by extension on public health and economic productivity.

## Repository Structure

Hereâ€™s what you can find in this repository:

### 1. Thesis Document
[`1.Thesis.pdf`](https://github.com/pieropls/Work.Hours.and.Income-Effects.on.Sleep/blob/main/1.Thesis.pdf)

This document is the final written thesis that includes the introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion of the study.

**Highlights:**
- Examination of sleep pattern disparities based on income and work hours.
- Analysis of health and productivity impacts due to varying sleep quality and duration.
